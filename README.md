This project proposes a comprehensive home security solution incorporating
five core modules:
1. Facial Recognition System: Secure access is ensured by verifying authorized
individuals through advanced face detection technology.
2. Fingerprint Authentication: An additional biometric layer enhances access
control, preventing unauthorized entry.
3. Gas Leakage Detection: Real-time monitoring of hazardous gas leaks
minimizes risks to health and safety.
4. Wet Floor Detection: Alerts for wet surfaces reduce the likelihood of accidents,
particularly for elderly residents.
5. Smart Appliance Control: A mobile application allows users to remotely
control household appliances and manage security alerts, fostering a proactive
and connected environment.
Through this innovative approach, the proposed framework not only addresses current
limitations in home security but also aligns with global sustainability and safety goals.
